## What's New?

### v2.3.2 :u-badge{label="Latest" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

Released on October 18, 2024.

**🚀 Features**

- New [`translateSlug`](/docs/content-translator/php-api#translateslug) PHP API method.
- [Bulk translation](/docs/content-translator/configuration#bulk): The content of all secondary languages is overwritten with the data of the default language and then translated into the respective language.

::

Unlike per-language translation, this translation process **is not reversible** in the Panel and is handled server-side. Use it with caution, as it may take a while to translate all content. When the button is clicked, a confirmation dialog is displayed to prevent accidental bulk translation.

If this new feature breaks your workflow, you can disable it by setting `bulk: false` in the plugin configuration.
::

When disabled, the section will look the same as in v2.2.0 and earlier versions:
